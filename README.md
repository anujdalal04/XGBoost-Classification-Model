# XGBoost Classification Model

This project implements an XGBoost model on a structured dataset to perform classification. The notebook includes preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Feature importance visualization is also included.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Train-test split and model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation with standard metrics
- Feature importance analysis

## Tech Stack
- Python
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
```

pip install xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

```
2. Open and run: `XGBoost_Implementation.ipynb`

## Results
Outputs accuracy scores, evaluation metrics, and feature importance plot for model interpretation.

## Dataset
Structured dataset used for educational and experimental purposes.
